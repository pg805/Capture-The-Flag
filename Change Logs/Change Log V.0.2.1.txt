First list is a technical summary. Second list is for end users(IE general players).


CHANGE LOG:

-Fixed a wallfall bug where it wouldn't replace the grass blocks properly.

-Traded Lootcrates now have name and lore tags, meaning they are now detected properly.

-Fixed issue with turrets where the command would detect a player from each team and spawn two turrets at once. Now uses a split argument to target *only* the literal nearest player for detection purposes.

-Added a teleport to move spectators to the map when the game starts

-Spectators no longer get set to survival when the game starts

-Fixed coordinate for detection of Blue stations.

-Made the Construction function for the falling blocks overlayed on barrier blocks run on a scheduled loop every three in-game days. This is to prevent despawning and make their life essentially infinite.

-Doubled the numbers involved in Class Station charging, but kept charge rate the same, essentially doubling the cooldown period but allowing the same number of charges to be stored.

-Increased the downtime of Shrines from three minutes to five, making captures more effective.

-Added actionbar titles messages stating whether you are currently capturing a Shrine, and a 'ding' and message when capture is complete.

-Lobby parkour has been repaired

-Barriers have been added to the Class Selection lobbies to prevent leaving the areas or interacting with the other team

-Added a text armorstand to Class Selection lobbies to warn against using items

-Removed ten obsolete scoreboards

-Added a cap to respawn time at an experimental 60 seconds. This is reached after 15 deaths under the current scheme.

-Reduced the Luck from Nebris's cheated potion from 5 to 2. Luck is now part of lootchests and the potion was overpowered for this purpose.

-Fixed a bug where Final Glitterworks rockets were gaining the lifetime boost meant for vanilla rockets

NOOB CHANGE LOG:

-Shop lootchests are fixed.

-Turrets should now spawn on the correct team.

-Blue Team stations now work as intended.

-Changed the cooldown rate on Class Stations from ten seconds to twenty. 

-Added notification to Shrine Capturing, to make it more clear to the capturer that it is happening.

-Respawn time capped at 60 seconds, with 15 deaths. This is arbitrary and will be changed depending on how it works out.
